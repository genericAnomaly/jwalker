# TODO and Feature Wishlist

## High Priority
* adventure editor/toolkit
* Function to preload all resources before starting the game.

## Todo
* Features
	* variables and logic
* Sounds
	* clean looping
	* ability to play multiple tracks (ie, music and bird sfx) at the same time
	* can change music when you enter a new room or keep it running without starting over
	* one-shot sfx when you click on something? like, imagining a dull thud when you touch the Orb in the den
	* clicking sfx every time you click on something
	* sounds that trigger the first time you enter the room but not ever again (thinking here, voiceover work?)
* Coding practices
	* Define resource paths in meta for stuff like demo/img

## Reevaluate
* a dedicated back button that sends you back to the previous place you were, since it turns out it's hard to find pictures with at least one entrance and exit in-photo
	* per-room option to override back button with a custom click object.
* Preload adjacent rooms, possibly even keep them in the DOM to avoid the "blink" between rooms

## Done
* ~~HUD text pop-up event~~, or just a hovering image in general.
* ~~customizable pointers~~
* ~~PROPER class-based customizable pointers~~
	* *I sketched some hella sweet retro cursors for this for now*
* ~~prevent players from using the tab functionality to find hotspots~~
* ~~Use jQuery binds instead of href="javascript:function(args)"~~
